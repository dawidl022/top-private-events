# Private Events

## Ruby on Rails course - The Odin Project

Project for practising building a Ruby on Rails application with multiple join
tables and non-default named associations.

<!-- TODO add link to Heroku and screenshots when page is sufficiently styled -->

[Project: Private Events](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/private-events)
is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## About the Application

The application allows users to create events, which are either publicly listed
on the main page and any other user can sign up for, or are private and the
creator of the event can choose to invite other users.

## Tasks left to-do

- Add minimal styling to the page to make it user-friendly
- Implement invitation system that allows an inviter to search for a user and
  send an invitation
